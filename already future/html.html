                operator. This means: The machine does not replace the  <br>
                human, but complements his capabilities and relieves him <br>
                of arduous tasks. These can include overhead work, for <br>
                example, or the lifting of heavy loads. Autonomous, <br>
                collaborative robots are also used to supply production <br>

                      There are so many choices, it’s <br>
                       almost impossible to figure out  <br>

                       area — robotics — and it made <br>
                        my job a lot easier. Or it should <br>
                         have. Turns out, there are so <br>
                          many choices in the field of <br>
